# Zteem.io
Derived from SWnEWn. Improved game and integrated Steem blockchain.

## How to build
Install pixijs, pixi-sound, sat-js, sc2-sdk, dsteem, dompurify and cookies-js using npm. Use watchify (or equivalent) to bundle the scripts (set src/main.js as target) into a file called bundle.js and saved in zteemio_files/.

## How to test
Put the file zteemio + zteemio_files on a web server and visit url in browser to test game. Or use a local server (I use python -m SimpleHTTPServer in console from directory of project). Or use Firefox and open the file directly.
